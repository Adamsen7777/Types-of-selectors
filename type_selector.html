        <h1>Yamaha R15 Review</h1>
        <p>Walking up to the motorcycle, it is apparent that the new R15 looks even better than what the pictures suggest. As has been the case with the R15s of yore, version 4.0 takes its design cues from a bigger Yamaha R-series motorcycle. This time around, it is a copy of the 2021 YZF-R7, and that's a great place to begin with.
    
            The front end looks sharp and aggressive with the bi-functional LED projector headlight sitting inside the faux air intake. The LED position lights that flank the headlamp appear like a set of mean eyes, whilst lending it a contemporary look.
            
            Slotted above the front fairing is a new windscreen that's shaped very well to shield you from head-on wind. Yamaha claims this fairing is more aerodynamic, helping it achieve its near-150kph top speed with a little more ease. That is something we'll verify, if and when we take this motorcycle for a track day.</p>
    
        <h1>CBR 150 Review</h1>
        <p>When Honda launched the CBR150R at the 2012 Auto Expo, everybody was taken by surprise. The reason behind the shock was that the motorcycle was already present in India at the Chennai MMSC race track for Honda training school. Honda decided to enter this fast growing 150 cc segment. Just a year before that, the Honda CBR150R was updated with fuel injection in Thailand, which was subsequently launched in India. The CBR150R has been received well by the Indian market and Honda is selling decent numbers of this machine too. We ride it for longer than the usual to find out how it’s like to live with the baby CBR.</p>
